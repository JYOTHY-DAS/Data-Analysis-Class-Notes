# Probability Distributions and Related Concepts

## 1. Probability Distributions
A probability distribution represents how the probabilities of a random variable are distributed over its possible values.

### 1.1 Uniform Distribution
- **Definition**: All events have an equal probability of occurring.
- **Example**: Rolling a fair six-sided die, where each face has an equal probability (1/6).

### 1.2 Non-Uniform Distribution
- **Definition**: Events do not have equal probabilities of occurring.
- **Example**: The probability of rainfall on different days in a year.

## 2. Gaussian Probability Distribution
- Also known as the **Normal Distribution**, it is a type of continuous probability distribution.

### 2.1 Normal Distribution
- **Definition**: A symmetric, bell-shaped curve where most data points cluster around the mean.
- **Properties**:
  - Mean = Median = Mode.
  - Approximately 68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
  - Approximately 95% of data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
- **Applications**:
  - Used to model heights, test scores, and measurement errors.

### 2.2 Log-Normal Distribution
- **Definition**: A distribution of a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.
- **Why Use Log-Normal?**:
  - Many real-world processes grow multiplicatively (e.g., stock prices, income).
  - The log-normal transformation makes the data easier to model and interpret.
- **Example**: Modeling the distribution of household incomes.

## 3. Symmetric Distribution
- **Definition**: A distribution where the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.
- **Examples**:
  - Normal Distribution.
  - Uniform Distribution (if the range is evenly centered).

## 4. Function Transformations
- **Why Transform a Function?**:
  - Simplifies complex operations.
  - Example: Transformations can convert multiplication into addition, making calculations more efficient.
- **Example**:
  - Original Function: f(x) = a.b
  - Log Transformation: log(f(x)) = log(a) + log(b)

## 5. Cascading of Functions
- **Definition**: Applying one function after another in sequence.
- **Example**:
  - First Function:  y = 2x
  - Second Function: z = y²
  - Combined Result: z = (2x)² = 4x²

## 6. Inequality in Probability Bounds

## 6.1 Inequality in Probability Bounds (Chebyshev's Inequality)
- In the context of continuous distributions, inequalities like **Chebyshev's inequality** are used to estimate the proportion of data within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean.
- **Chebyshev's Inequality**:
  ```
  P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}
  ```
  This inequality applies to any distribution (not just Gaussian) and helps bound the probability that a random variable deviates significantly from its mean.

## 6.2 Tail Inequalities in Gaussian Distribution
- The Gaussian distribution has well-defined **tails**, and inequalities help calculate or approximate the probability in these tails.
- **Example**: The probability that a random variable `X` from a standard normal distribution exceeds a specific value `z`, i.e., `P(X > z)`, can be approximated or bounded.

## 6.3 Defining Confidence Intervals
- Continuous distributions like Gaussian are frequently used to calculate **confidence intervals**. Inequalities help establish bounds for these intervals.
- **Example**: For a standard Gaussian distribution, the probability of data falling within \( \pm z \) standard deviations is related to inequalities, like:
  ```
  P(-z \leq X \leq z) = 1 - \alpha
  ```
  where \( \alpha \) represents the significance level.

## 6.4 Optimization Problems in Probability
- Inequalities are also essential in deriving mathematical results, like minimizing or maximizing probabilities under constraints. For Gaussian distributions, such optimization frequently arises in hypothesis testing or model fitting.

## 6.5 Link to Symmetry
- For symmetric distributions like Gaussian, inequalities can highlight symmetry-related probabilities. For example:
  ```
  P(X \geq \mu + k\sigma) = P(X \leq \mu - k\sigma)
  ```

## 7. Types of Distributions

### 7.1 Continuous Distribution
- **Definition**: A distribution where the random variable can take any value within a range.
- **Examples**:
  - Height of individuals.
  - Gaussian distribution.

### 7.2 Discrete Distribution
- **Definition**: A distribution where the random variable can only take specific, distinct values.
- **Examples**:
  - Number of students in a class.
  - Rolling a die.

#### Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- **Definition**: A function that gives the probability of each possible value of a discrete random variable.
- **Example**:
  - Rolling a die: PMF assigns P(X = x) = 1/6 for ( x = 1, 2, ...., 6).

---

## 8. Bernoulli Distribution
- **Definition**: A special case of a discrete distribution where there are only two possible outcomes (success or failure).
- **Properties**:
  - The probability of success is (p), and the probability of failure is (1 - p).
- **Examples**:
  - Tossing a coin (Heads or Tails).
  - Passing or failing a test.

## 9. Variance and Covariance

### 9.1 Variance
- **Definition**: Measures the spread of a single random variable by quantifying the average squared deviation from its mean.
- **Formula**:
  - $$\( \text{Variance} = \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2 \) $$
 
- **Example**:
  - Variance of test scores in a class.

### 9.2 Covariance
- **Definition**: Measures how two random variables vary together.
- **Formula**:
  - $$\( \text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu_X)(y_i - \mu_Y) \) $$
- **Interpretation**:
  - Positive covariance: Variables increase together.
  - Negative covariance: One variable increases while the other decreases.
- **Example**:
  - Relationship between study hours (X) and test scores (Y).
