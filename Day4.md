# Statistics
## Measures of central tendency 
### Mean (Average)
### Median
### Mode
### Percentile
## Dispersion
### Range
### Standard Deviation
### Quartiles
* #### Outliers
* 25th percentile
* 50th percentile
* 75th percentile
* Lower bound
* Upper bound
## Correlation: 
* Pearson coefficient:
* Scatter plot
## Histogram- Probability density function
* Bell curve: 68% data within first standard deviation and 98 percentage data within second standard deviation.
* Bimodal distribution
* Cumulative sum of histogram bars-Cumulative density function
## Scaling
* Z-Score
* Min-Max Scaling
## Types of distribution: 
* Skewed distribution: Posititve and negative
## WHy we need both variance and standard deviation?
