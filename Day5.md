# Inferential Statistics

## 1. Binomial Distribution
- A discrete probability distribution used for a fixed number of trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).
- Example: Tossing a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads.

---

## 2. Probability
- **Definition**: The likelihood of an event occurring.
- Central Limit Theorem: As the number of trials increases, the distribution becomes more like a bell curve.
- **Example**: Calculating the probability of rolling a 6 on a die.

## 3. Gaussian Distribution
- Also known as the **Normal Distribution**.
- A continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped.
- Commonly observed in natural phenomena, such as heights, test scores, and measurement errors.

---

## 4. Sampling
- **Definition**: Selecting a subset of data from a population to make inferences about the entire population.
- **Use Case**: Conducting a survey of 1,000 people to understand the opinions of a city’s population.

---

## 5. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- **Key Concept**: Regardless of the population's distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.
- **Importance**:
  - Forms the foundation of inferential statistics.
  - Justifies the use of normal distribution for hypothesis testing.

## 6. Significance Level (Alpha Value)
- **Definition**: The threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.
- **Common Value**: 0.05 (5%).
- Represents the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis).

---

## 7. P-Value
- **Definition**: The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- **Key Points**:
  - If 𝑃 > 𝛼, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
  - If 𝑃 &le; 𝛼, reject the null hypothesis.
- **Example**:
  - Null Hypothesis: A new drug has no effect.
  - Alternate Hypothesis: The new drug improves patient recovery.

## 8. Z-Test
- **Used When**:
  - Sample size is large (n &ge;30).
  - Population standard deviation is known.
  - Data is approximately normally distributed.
- **Example**: Comparing the mean test scores of two large student groups to evaluate teaching methods.

---

## 9. T-Test
- **Used When**:
  - Sample size is small.
  - Population standard deviation is unknown.
- **Types**:
  - **One-sample T-test**: Compares the sample mean to a known value.
  - **Two-sample T-test**: Compares the means of two independent groups.
  - **Paired T-test**: Compares means of the same group at two different times.
- **Use Case**: Testing whether a new teaching method improves test scores compared to the old method.
